WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Thursday 49-47 to confirm a top air quality official at the Environmental Protection Agency, despite concerns raised by lawmakers over his industry ties. William Wehrum, who had represented industry clients at law and lobbying firm Hunton & Williams, will serve as the EPA’s assistant administrator for Air and Radiation, its top position for overseeing key air quality regulations. Wehrum is now only the second high-level EPA official after Administrator Scott Pruitt to be confirmed by Senate. Wehrum had served as the EPA’s acting assistant administrator for Air and Radiation from 2005 to 2007 under former President George W. Bush. After leaving government, he was the head of the administrative law group at Hunton & Williams focused on air quality issues for industry clients, such as ExxonMobil Corp. Democratic Senator Tom Carper of Delaware had urged colleagues to reject Wehrum’s confirmation ahead of the vote. “Bill Wehrum has spent most of his career fighting to dismantle the federal environmental protections that so many states, including Delaware, depend on to clean up toxic air pollution,” Carper said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wehrum would “continue the work of this EPA to undo the damage of the Obama administration’s overreach.”

Inudukan ni Department of Labor and Employment Undersecretary Jacinto ""Jing"" Paras ang National Bureau of Investigation na magsagawa ng imbestigasyon laban kay Vice President Leni Robredo. Ito ay kaugnay ng Bikoy video na ginagamit para siraan ang Pamilya Duterte at tanggalin ang Presidente sa posisyon nito. ""Hinihikayat ko ang NBI na pati si Robredo ay imbestigahan nila,"" sabi ni Paras. Hindi rin nakaligtas kay Paras si Senador Antonio Trillanes. Ayon sa opisyal, posibleng sangkot din ito sa mapanirang video. ""At the center of this controversy, a certain Ellen Tordesillas, itong si Ellen Tordesillas ay identified kay Trillanes. In fact, Paolo Duterte, identified Trillanes as the mastermind of this Bikoy tapes. And it is the same Trillanes na sinamapahan namin ni Attorney Luna ng kaso na ini-indict na ng korte,"" dagdag pa ni Paras. Kamakailan lang ay pumutok ang balita tungkol sa pagkakahuli kay Rodel Jayme, ang webmaster ng website na Metrobalita.net, isa sa mga unang nagpakalat ng video series na may titulong ""Ang Totoong Narco List"", kung saan isang alyas ""Bikoy"" ang yumuyurak sa pamilya ng Pangulong Duterte sa pamamagitan ng pagdawit sa mga ito sa bentahan ng droga. Ayon sa ilang ulat at pahayag ni Jayme, wala daw siyang koneksyon sa opisina ni Robredo at nagpa-picture lang daw siya kay VP noong panahon ng halalan dahil isa siyang taga-suporta. Sa pahina ng NBI report na inilabas ng CNN Philippines, isang nagngangalang ""Filmore"" ang nabanggit at ito daw ay kasapi ng grupong Magdalo. Source: Eagle New | News5 | CNN Phil

Wisconsin police were widening their hunt Saturday for a 32-year-old man who allegedly burglarized a gun store after mailing an anti-government manifesto to President Donald Trump.Joseph Jakubowski has been on the run since Tuesday, when police say he broke into the Armageddon Gun Shop in Janesville, south of Madison, and stole 16 high-caliber rifles and handguns. He is believed to be armed and dangerous, and traveling with a bulletproof vest and helmet, according to authorities.At a news conference Friday, Rock County Sheriff Robert Spoden said Jakubowski had been highly agitated by national politics recently and had confessed to friends that he had plans to steal guns and conduct an  unspecified attack. Janesville Police Chief David Moore said his department has also had multiple run-ins with Jakubowski over the years. There was one specific case where he attempted to disarm a police officer,  Moore told reporters.  Were it not for the very secure holster of this police officer, he would have certainly disarmed that police officer. And for that crime, (he) was sent to prison.  Police released a video Jakubowski allegedly posted to Facebook that shows a man mailing a large envelope clearly addressed to Trump and the White House.Authorities say the package contained a 160-page manifesto that featured anti-government rants and  personal angst against anything other than natural law or rule.
